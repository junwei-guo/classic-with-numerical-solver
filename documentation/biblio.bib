              newly-developed representative concentration pathways (RCPs) of
              greenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosols. Allowable emissions
              required to achieve the future atmospheric CO2 concentration
              pathways, are reported for the RCP 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios.
              For the historical 1850–2005 period, cumulative land plus ocean
              carbon uptake and, consequently, cumulative diagnosed emissions
              compare well with observation-based estimates. The simulated
              historical carbon uptake is somewhat weaker for the ocean and
              stronger for the land relative to their observation-based
              estimates. The simulated historical warming of 0.9°C compares
              well with the observation-based estimate of 0.76 ± 0.19°C. The
              RCP 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios respectively yield warmings of
              1.4, 2.3, and 4.9°C and cumulative diagnosed fossil fuel
              emissions of 182, 643 and 1617 Pg C over the 2006–2100 period.
              The simulated warming of 2.3°C over the 1850–2100 period in the
              RCP 2.6 scenario, with the lowest concentration of GHGs, is
              slightly larger than the 2°C warming target set to avoid
              dangerous climate change by the 2009 UN Copenhagen Accord. The
              results of this study suggest that limiting warming to roughly
              2°C by the end of this century is unlikely since it requires an
              immediate ramp down of emissions followed by ongoing carbon
              sequestration in the second half of this century.",

  abstract  = "Abstract Analytical expressions of evaporative efficiency over
               bare soil (defined as the ratio of actual to potential soil
               evaporation) have been limited to soil layers with a fixed depth
               and/or to specific atmospheric conditions. To fill the gap, a
               new analytical model is developed for arbitrary soil thicknesses
               and varying boundary layer conditions. The soil evaporative
               efficiency is written [0.5 ? 0.5 cos(π?L/?max)]P with ?L being
               the water content in the soil layer of thickness L, ?max being
               the soil moisture at saturation, and P being a function of L and
               potential soil evaporation. This formulation predicts soil
               evaporative efficiency in both energy-driven and moisture-driven
               conditions, which correspond to P 0.5, respectively. For P =
               0.5, an equilibrium state is identified when retention forces in
               the soil compensate the evaporative demand above the soil
               surface. The approach is applied to in situ measurements of
               actual evaporation, potential evaporation, and soil moisture at
               five different depths (5, 10, 30, 60, and 100 cm) collected in
               summer at two sites in southwestern France. It is found that (i)
               soil evaporative efficiency cannot be considered as a function
               of soil moisture only because it also depends on potential
               evaporation, (ii) retention forces in the soil increase in
               reaction to an increase of potential evaporation, and (iii) the
               model is able to accurately predict the soil evaporation process
               for soil layers with an arbitrary thickness up to 100 cm. This
               new model representation is expected to facilitate the coupling
               of land surface models with multisensor (multisensing depth)

               separately. The energy balance equation is solved iteratively
               for the surface temperature; the surface infiltration rate is
               calculated using a simplified theoretical analysis allowing for
               surface ponding. Snow cover is modelled as a discrete `soil'

               with CLASS (Canadian Land Surface Scheme) was outlined. In this
               paper, the accompanying vegetation model is described. This
               model includes physically based treatment of energy and moisture
               fluxes from the canopy as well as radiation and precipitation
               cascades through it, and incorporates explicit thermal
               separation of the vegetation from the underlying ground.
               Seasonal variations of canopy parameters are accounted for. The
               morphological characteristics of the `composite canopy'
               associated with each grid square are calculated as weighted
               averages over the vegetation types present. Each grid square is
               divided into a maximum of four separate subareas: bare soil,
               snow-covered, vegetation-covered, and snow-and-vegetation
               covered.Test runs were done in coupled mode with the Canadian
               Climate Centre GCM, to evaluate the performance of CLASS
               compared with that of the simpler land surface scheme previously
               used. Two versions of CLASS were run: one with ponded surface
               water saved between time steps, and one with it discarded. For
               the seasons of June—July—August and December—January—February,
               diagnostic calculations showed that the old scheme
               underestimated the globally averaged land surface screen
               temperature by as much as 3.0°C, and overestimated the globally
               averaged precipitation rate over land by up to 1.0 mm day−1.
               CLASS, on the other hand, produced screen temperature anomalies,
               varying in sign, of 0.2–0.3°C, and positive precipitation
               anomalies of 0.6–0.7 mm day−1. The relatively poor performance
               of the old model was attributed to its neglect of vegetation
               stomatal resistance, its assumption that the contents of the
               soil moisture `bucket' had to be completely frozen before the
               surface temperature could fall below 0°C, and its use of the
               force-restore method for soil temperatures, which systematically
               neglects long-term thermal forcing from the soil substrate. The
               assumption made in most GCMs that excess surface water
               immediately becomes overland runoff is shown to result in
               substantial overestimates of surface screen temperatures in

              of a canopy with intercepted snow, αVIS,cs and αNIR,cs,
              respectively, were too small, and the fraction of the canopy
              covered with snow, fsnow, increased too slowly with interception,
              producing a damped albedo response. A new model for fsnow is
              based on zI*, the effective depth of newly intercepted snow
              required to increase the canopy albedo to its maximum, which
              corresponds in the model with fsnow = 1. Snow unloading rates
              were extracted from visual assessments of photographs and
              modelled based on relationships with meteorological variables,
              replacing the time-based method employed in CLASS. These
              parameterizations were tested in CLASS version 3.6 at boreal
              black spruce and jack pine forests in Saskatchewan, Canada, a
              subalpine Norway spruce and silver fir forest at Alptal,
              Switzerland, and a boreal maritime forest at Hitsujigaoka, Japan.
              Model configurations were assessed based on the index of
              agreement, d, relating simulated and observed daily albedo. The
              new model employs αVIS,cs = 0.27, αNIR,cs = 0.38 and zI* = 3 cm.
              The best single-variable snow unloading algorithm, determined by
              the average cross-site d, was based on wind speed. Two model
              configurations employing ensemble averages of the unloading rate

              temperature and wind speed, respectively, produced larger minimum
              cross-site d values but a smaller average. The default
              configuration of CLASS 3.6 produced a cross-site average d from
              October to April of 0.58. The best model employing a single
              parameter (wind speed at the canopy top) for modelling the
              unloading rate produced an average d of 0.86, while the

              and water-stressed wheat. Canopy temperatures are additionally
              obtained from an energy balance equation and compared with

              simulated and observed evaporation fluxes yields a correlation
              coefficient of 0.98 and a standard error of estimate of about 37
              W m−2; while for the canopy temperatures the correlation

               contains a number of new algorithms of significance for snow
               simulations in the boreal forest. In particular, mixed
               precipitation is now modelled, the density of fresh snow varies
               with temperature and the maximum snowpack density varies with
               snow depth. A model for canopy interception and unloading of
               snow developed in the Canadian boreal forest has also been
               implemented. In this paper, nine?month column runs of CLASS 3.1
               are compared with CLASS 2.7, the current operational version.
               The model runs span the winter of 2002?03 at three boreal forest
               sites: a mature aspen stand, a mature jack pine stand and a
               mature black spruce stand, all located in central Saskatchewan.
               The focus is on the winter performance and the representation of
               snow. More accurate (lower) values of modelled snow density
               improve the modelled snowpack depth. The accuracy of the canopy
               interception algorithm could not be tested directly with respect
               to measured interception, but results suggest that the ability
               to unload intercepted snow is important for accurate estimates
               of sublimation loss, and that simulated snow water equivalent is
               sensitive to perceived canopy gap fraction, interception
               capacity, and unloading rate. Underestimation of the canopy gap
               fraction increases canopy interception and sublimation losses,
               and decreases snow water equivalent in the snowpack, and vice
               versa. Employing modified gap fraction values improved the
               modelled snow water equivalent at two of the sites.
               Modifications to the model are suggested to allow the total
               albedo to respond to changes in the modelled sub?canopy albedo.",

               forecasting models at various resolutions requiring the use of
               effective or aggregated parameters to adequately represent each

               aggregating the surface parameters for the Canadian Land Surface
               Scheme (CLASS). The method consists of running a one?dimensional
               version of CLASS over a period of 105 days in summer using
               meteorological data observed at an agricultural site near Quebec
               City. The aggregation of parameters is tested by successively
               running the model with two homogeneous values (usually a small
               one and a large one) of a chosen parameter and then with a mean
               or aggregated value of that parameter; the results of the latter
               run are then compared with the area?averaged results of the two
               homogeneous runs. Vegetation coverage, rooting depth, soil
               texture and roughness lengths are the input parameters thus
               tested. Heterogeneity of soil moisture content due to uneven
               distribution of precipitation is also discussed. The results
               indicate that the sub?areas of CLASS must have their own soil
               variables, that roots must occupy full soil layers and not part
               of a layer, and that the aggregating rule for the roughness
               lengths (zo for momentum and zot for heat and moisture) should
               be changed from the current logarithmic averages to the blending
               height method for zo and to a new formula involving both
               roughness lengths for zot. The surface?layer scheme in CLASS was
               found inadequate and replaced. Results for soil texture
               aggregation are not as clear; it seems difficult to obtain
               simultaneously a good averaging of atmospheric energy fluxes and
               a good averaging of soil moisture contents, runoff and drainage.
               Horizontal variability of soil moisture due to uneven
               distribution of rainfall generates an overestimate of
               evapotranspiration and an underestimate of runoff in an
               aggregated model lacking this effect. Preliminary results
               indicate that, in order to effectively parametrize this effect
               in CLASS, both surface ponding capacity and ground infiltration

               parameterized for use in numerical models of the general

               to be consistent with recent advances in knowledge of both the
               planetary boundary layer and the surface layer. A key quantity
               throughout is the height, h, of the planetary boundary layer,
               which appears in the governing stability parameter, a bulk
               Richardson number. With upward heat flux, a time-dependent
               prediction equation is proposed for h that incorporates
               penetrative convection and vertical motion. Under stable
               conditions, h is assumed to depart from the neutral value and to
               become nearly proportional to the Monin-Obukhov length. The
               roughness length, Zo, is incorporated in the combination h/zo,
               and the parameterization is consistent with h/zo affecting only
               the wind component in the direction of the surface velocity. The
               direction of the surface wind and stress is derived in a manner
               consistent with the known value of the surface pressure gradient
               and theoretical studies of the decrease of stress with height.

               parameterize in terrestrial ecosystem models because our
               understanding of the physical processes that initiate leaf onset
               and senescence is incomplete. While progress has been made at
               the molecular level, for example by identifying genes that are
               associated with senescence and flowering for selected plant
               species, a picture of the processes controlling leaf phenology
               is only beginning to emerge. A variety of empirical formulations
               have been used with varying degrees of success in terrestrial
               ecosystem models for both extratropical and tropical biomes. For
               instance, the use of growing degree-days (GDDs) to initiate leaf
               onset has received considerable recognition and this approach is
               used in a number of models. There are, however, limitations when
               using GDDs and other empirically based formulations in global
               transient climate change simulations.The phenology scheme
               developed for the Canadian Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (CTEM),
               designed for inclusion in the Canadian Centre for Climate
               Modelling and Analysis coupled general circulation model, is
               described. The representation of leaf phenology is general
               enough to be applied over the globe and sufficiently robust for
               use in transient climate change simulations. Leaf phenology is
               functionally related to the (possibly changing) climate state
               and to atmospheric composition rather than to geographical
               boundaries or controls implicitly based on current climate. In
               this approach, phenology is controlled by environmental
               conditions as they affect the carbon balance. A
               carbon-gain-based scheme initiates leaf onset when it is
               beneficial for the plant, in carbon terms, to produce new
               leaves. Leaf offset is initiated by unfavourable environmental
               conditions that incur carbon losses and these include shorter
               day length, cooler temperatures, and dry soil moisture
               conditions. The comparison of simulated leaf onset and offset
               times with observation-based estimates for temperate and boreal
               deciduous, tropical evergreen, and tropical deciduous plant
               functional types at selected locations indicates that the

               Here, in a comprehensive literature synthesis, we analyze
               rooting patterns for terrestrial biomes and compare
               distributions for various plant functional groups. We compiled a
               database of 250 root studies, subdividing suitable results into
               11 biomes, and fitted the depth coefficient β to the data for
               each biome (Gale and Grigal 1987). β is a simple numerical index
               of rooting distribution based on the asymptotic equation Y=1-βd,
               where d = depth and Y = the proportion of roots from the surface

              determined by climate, and where bioclimatic parameters are
              favorable for several plant functional types (PFTs), by the
              competition between them. Most current dynamic global vegetation
              models (DGVMs) do not, however, explicitly simulate inter-PFT
              competition and instead determine the existence and fractional
              coverage of PFTs based on quasi-equilibrium climate–vegetation
              relationships. When competition is explicitly simulated, versions
              of Lotka–Volterra (LV) equations developed in the context of
              interaction between animal species are almost always used. These
              equations may, however, exhibit unrealistic behavior in some
              cases and do not, for example, allow the coexistence of different
              PFTs in equilibrium situations. Coexistence may, however, be
              obtained by introducing features and mechanisms such as temporal
              environmental variation and disturbance, among others. A
              generalized version of the competition equations is proposed that
              includes the LV equations as a special case, which successfully
              models competition for a range of climate and vegetation regimes
              and for which coexistence is a permissible equilibrium solution
              in the absence of additional mechanisms. The approach is tested

  abstract  = "* 1The first trees establishing in grasslands may indirectly
               favour their seedlings in competition with neighbouring
               herbaceous vegetation by increasing soil fertility with
               nitrogen-rich litter and by reducing light levels under their
               canopies. It is predicted that increasing soil nitrogen
               availability will accelerate invasion of trees by stimulating
               their growth more than that of herbaceous species. Decreasing
               light availability is predicted to increase tree invasion by
               limiting the growth of herbaceous vegetation more than that of
               trees (competitive release). * 2We tested these predictions
               using Chinese tallow tree (Sapium sebiferum), which is an
               aggressive alien invader of grasslands in the southern USA, and
               Hackberry (Celtis laevigata), which is a native tree common in
               these grasslands. * 3Nitrogen and light were manipulated in two
               factorial field experiments in grasslands in Texas, USA. In the
               first, nitrogen was increased and light was decreased in plots
               with planted Celtis or Sapium seedlings. In the second
               experiment, light availability to planted Celtis or Sapium
               seedlings was increased by holding back prairie vegetation. *
               4In the first experiment, growth of Celtis and Sapium seedlings
               increased with nitrogen fertilization while the above-ground
               biomass of prairie vegetation did not change. Prairie vegetation
               biomass decreased and tree seedling growth increased under
               shading. Sapium's growth increased dramatically in the treatment
               with combined nitrogen and shade. Sapium survival decreased when
               shade was applied. * 5In the second experiment, Sapium growth
               increased with increased light. Thus, increased Sapium growth at
               low light levels in the shade experiment was probably a
               consequence of decreased competitive interference from prairie
               vegetation, rather than better absolute performance of Sapium in
               low light levels. * 6These results provide evidence for
               facilitation as a mechanism involved in tree invasions of
               grasslands. Changes in resource levels, perhaps in combination
               with other factors, may explain rapid conversion of grassland
               communities to woodlands after the first pioneer trees are
               established. The marked response of Sapium to the combination of
               nitrogen and shade suggests that these positive feedbacks may be
               particularly strong for this alien plant species.",

              represent an important biogeochemical pathway by which the
              biosphere affects climate. For climate change studies it is
              important to model fire as a mechanistic climate-dependent
              process in dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) and the
              terrestrial ecosystem components of climate models. We expand on
              those current approaches which neglect disturbance by fire, which
              use constant specified loss rates, or which depend on simple
              empirical relationships, and develop a process-based fire
              parameterization for use in the terrestrial ecosystem components
              of climate and Earth system models. The approach is
              straightforward and general enough to apply globally and for
              current and future climates. All three aspects of the fire
              triangle, fuel availability, the readiness of fuel to burn
              depending on conditions, and the presence of an ignition source,
              are taken into account. The approach also represents some
              anthropogenic effects on natural fire regimes, albeit in a simple

              parameterization generates burned area, alters vegetation

              interannual variability of the burned area: the model bias is
              reduced by 45\%, and the explained variance is increased by about

              incorporating important fine-scale processes into global
              ecosystem models. Our knowledge of fine-scale physiological and
              ecological processes comes from a variety of measurements,
              ranging from forest plot inventories to remote sensing, made at
              spatial resolutions considerably smaller than the large scale at
              which global ecosystem models are defined. In this paper, we
              describe a new individual-based, terrestrial biosphere model,
              which we label the ecosystem demography model (ED). We then
              introduce a general method for scaling stochastic
              individual-based models of ecosystem dynamics (gap models) such
              as ED to large scales. The method accounts for the fine-scale
              spatial heterogeneity within an ecosystem caused by stochastic
              disturbance events, operating at scales down to individual
              canopy-tree-sized gaps. By conditioning appropriately on the
              occurrence of these events, we derive a size- and age-structured
              (SAS) approximation for the first moment of the stochastic
              ecosystem model. With this approximation, it is possible to make
              predictions about the large scales of interest from a description
              of the fine-scale physiological and population-dynamic processes
              without simulating the fate of every plant individually. We use
              the SAS approximation to implement our individual-based biosphere

              SAS equations are accurate across a range of environmental

              predictions of the biosphere model to regional data and to
              intensive data at specific sites. Analysis of the model at these
              sites illustrates the importance of fine-scale heterogeneity in
              governing large-scale ecosystem function, showing how population
              and community-level processes influence ecosystem composition and

               subsistence cultures to highly technological societies. The
               dynamics of these interactions with respect to wildland fire are
               often difficult to understand and identify at short temporal
               scales. Dendrochronological fire histories from the Missouri
               Ozarks, coupled with human population data, offer a quantitative
               means of examining historic (1680–1990) changes in the
               anthropogenic fire regime. A temporal analysis of fire scar
               dates over the last 3 centuries indicates that the percent of
               sites burned and fire intervals of anthropogenic fires are
               conditioned by the following four limiting factors: (a)
               anthropogenic ignition, (b) surface fuel production, (c) fuel
               fragmentation, and (d) cultural behavior. During an
               ignition-dependent stage (fewer than 0.64 humans/km2), the
               percent of sites burned is logarithmically related to human
               population (r 2 = 0.67). During a fuel-limited stage, where
               population density exceeds a threshold of 0.64 humans/km2, the
               percent of sites burned is independent of population increases
               and is limited by fuel production. During a fuel-fragmentation
               stage, regional trade allows population densities to increase
               above 3.4 humans/km2, and the percent of sites burned becomes
               inversely related to population (r 2 = 0.18) as decreases in
               fuel continuity limit the propagation of surface fires. During a
               culture-dependent stage, increases in the value of timber over
               forage greatly reduce the mean fire interval and the percent of
               sites burned. Examples of the dynamics of these four stages are
               presented from the Current River watershed of the Missouri
               Ozarks.",

              of canopy conductance to the land surface scheme, is designed to
              use both the big- and the two-leaf (sunlit/shaded) approaches,

              Model results for carbon and energy fluxes compare well with

              smaller (∼1\%) than the difference caused by the choice of the

               conventional Arrhenius relationships between T and R cannot
               provide an unbiased estimate of respiration rate. Nor is a
               simple linear relationship appropriate. 3. The relationship
               between R and T can, however, be accurately represented by an
               Arrhenius type equation where the effective activation energy
               for respiration varies inversely with temperature. An empirical
               equation is presented which yields an unbiased estimator of
               respiration rates over a wide range of temperatures. 4. When
               combined with seasonal estimates of Gross Primary Productivity
               (GPP) the empirical relationship derived provides representative
               estimates of the seasonal cycle of net ecosystem productivity

              the future dynamics of the large amount of C that is currently
              stored in soil organic matter. Will the amount of C in this pool
              increase or decrease with global warming? The future trend in
              amounts of soil organic C will depend on the relative temperature
              sensitivities of net primary productivity and soil organic matter
              decomposition rate. Equations for the temperature dependence of
              net primary productivity have been widely used, but the
              temperature dependence of decomposition rate is less clear. The
              literature was surveyed to obtain the temperature dependencies of
              soil respiration and N dynamics reported in different studies.
              Only laboratory-based measurements were used to avoid confounding
              effects with differences in litter input rates, litter quality,
              soil moisture or other environmental factors. A considerable
              range of values has been reported, with the greatest relative
              sensitivity of decomposition processes to temperature having been
              observed at low temperatures. A relationship fitted to the
              literature data indicated that the rate of decomposition
              increases with temperature at 0°C with a Q10 of almost 8. The
              temperature sensitivity of organic matter decomposition decreases
              with increasing temperature, indicated by the Q10 decreasing with
              temperature to be about 4.5 at 10°C and 2.5 at 20°C. At low
              temperatures, the temperature sensitivity of decomposition was
              consequently much greater than the temperature sensitivity of net
              primary productivity, whereas the temperature sensitivities
              became more similar at higher temperatures. The much higher
              temperature sensitivity of decomposition than for net primary
              productivity has important implications for the store of soil
              organic C in the soil. The data suggest that a 1°C increase in
              temperature could ultimately lead to a loss of over 10\% of soil
              organic C in regions of the world with an annual mean temperature
              of 5°C, whereas the same temperature increase would lead to a
              loss of only 3\% of soil organic C for a soil at 30°C. These
              differences are even greater in absolute amounts as cooler soils
              contain greater amounts of soil organic C. This analysis supports
              the conclusion of previous studies which indicated that soil
              organic C contents may decrease greatly with global warming and
              thereby provide a positive feed-back in the global C cycle.",

              strongly with atmospheric composition, climate, and land cover
              change. Our capacity to predict and ameliorate the consequences
              of global change depends in part on a better understanding of the
              distributions and controls of soil organic carbon (SOC) and how
              vegetation change may affect SOC distributions with depth. The
              goals of this paper are (1) to examine the association of SOC
              content with climate and soil texture at different soil depths;
              (2) to test the hypothesis that vegetation type, through patterns
              of allocation, is a dominant control on the vertical distribution
              of SOC; and (3) to estimate global SOC storage to 3 m, including
              an analysis of the potential effects of vegetation change on soil
              carbon storage. We based our analysis on >2700 soil profiles in
              three global databases supplemented with data for climate,
              vegetation, and land use. The analysis focused on mineral soil
              layers. Plant functional types significantly affected the
              vertical distribution of SOC. The percentage of SOC in the top 20
              cm (relative to the first meter) averaged 33\%, 42\%, and 50\%
              for shrublands, grasslands, and forests, respectively. In
              shrublands, the amount of SOC in the second and third meters was
              77\% of that in the first meter; in forests and grasslands, the
              totals were 56\% and 43\%, respectively. Globally, the relative
              distribution of SOC with depth had a slightly stronger
              association with vegetation than with climate, but the opposite
              was true for the absolute amount of SOC. Total SOC content
              increased with precipitation and clay content and decreased with
              temperature. The importance of these controls switched with
              depth, climate dominating in shallow layers and clay content
              dominating in deeper layers, possibly due to increasing
              percentages of slowly cycling SOC fractions at depth. To control
              for the effects of climate on vegetation, we grouped soils within
              climatic ranges and compared distributions for vegetation types
              within each range. The percentage of SOC in the top 20 cm
              relative to the first meter varied from 29\% in cold arid
              shrublands to 57\% in cold humid forests and, for a given
              climate, was always deepest in shrublands, intermediate in
              grasslands, and shallowest in forests (P < 0.05 in all cases).
              The effect of vegetation type was more important than the direct
              effect of precipitation in this analysis. These data suggest that
              shoot/root allocations combined with vertical root distributions,
              affect the distribution of SOC with depth. Global SOC storage in
              the top 3 m of soil was 2344 Pg C, or 56\% more than the 1502 Pg
              estimated for the first meter (which is similar to the total SOC
              estimates of 1500–1600 Pg made by other researchers). Global
              totals for the second and third meters were 491 and 351 Pg C, and
              the biomes with the most SOC at 1–3 m depth were tropical
              evergreen forests (158 Pg C) and tropical grasslands/savannas
              (146 Pg C). Our work suggests that plant functional types,
              through differences in allocation, help to control SOC
              distributions with depth in the soil. Our analysis also
              highlights the potential importance of vegetation change and SOC

              energy balance and mass transport sub-model is used to couple the
              physiological processes through a variable boundary layer to the
              ambient environment.The models are based on theoretical and
              empirical analysis of gs, and An measured at the leaf level, and
              tests with intact attached leaves of soybeans show very good
              agreement between predicted and measured responses of gs and An
              over a wide range of leaf temperatures (20–35°C), CO2
              concentrations (10–90 Pa), air to leaf water vapor deficits
              (0.5–3.7 kPa) and light intensities (100–2000 μmol m−2s−1).The
              combined models were used to simulate the responses of latent
              heat flux (λE) and gs for a soybean canopy for the course of an
              idealized summer day, using the ‘big-leaf’ approximation.
              Appropriate data are not yet available to provide a rigorous test
              of these simulations, but the response patterns are similar to
              field observations. These simulations show a pronounced midday
              depression of λE and gs at low or high values of boundary-layer
              conductance. Deterioration of plant water relations during midday
              has often been invoked to explain this common natural phenomenon,
              but the present models do not consider this possibility. Analysis
              of the model indicates that the simulated midday depression is,
              in part, the result of positive feedback mediated by the boundary
              layer. For example, a change in gs affects An and λE. As a
              consequence, the temperature, humidity and CO2 concentration of
              the air in the proximity of the stomata (e.g. the air at the leaf
              surface) change and these, in turn, affect gs. The simulations
              illustrate the possible significance of the boundary layer in
              mediating feedback loops which affect the regulation of stomatal
              conductance and λE. The simulations also examine the significance
              of changing the response properties of the photosynthetic
              component of the model by changing leaf protein content or the

              regional models of net primary productivity and surface energy
              balance. Since C 4 metabolism shows unique responses to
              environmental conditions and C 4 species are important
              agriculturally and ecologically, a realistic and accurate leaf
              model specific to C 4 plants is needed. In this paper we develop
              a simple model for predicting A n and g from leaves of C 4 plants
              that is easily parameterised and that predicts many of the
              important environmental responses. We derive the leaf model from
              a simple biochemical-intercellular transport model of C 4
              photosynthesis that includes inorganic carbon fixation by PEP
              carboxylase, light dependent generation of PEP and RuBP, rubisco
              reaction kinetics, and the diffusion of inorganic carbon and O 2
              between the bundle sheath and mesophyll. We argue that under most
              conditions these processes can be described simply as three
              potentially limiting steps. The leaf photosynthesis model treats
              A n as first order with respect to either light, CO 2 or the
              amount of rubisco present and produces a continuous transition
              between limitations. The independent variables of the leaf
              photosynthesis model are leaf temperature (T I ), intercellular
              CO 2 levels and the absorbed quantum flux. A simple linear model
              of g in terms of A n and leaf surface CO 2 level (p s ) and
              relative humidity (h s ) is combined with the photosynthesis
              model to give leaf photosynthesis as a function of absorbed
              quantum flux, T 1 and p s and h s levels. Gas exchange
              measurements from corn leaves exposed to varied light, CO 2 and
              temperature levels are used to parameterise and test the models.
              Model parameters are determined by fitting the models to a set of
              21 measurements. The behaviour of the models is compared with an
              independent set of 71 measurements, and the predictions are shown
              to be highly correlated with the data. Under most conditions the
              leaf model can be parameterised simply by determining the level
              of rubisco in the leaves. The effects of light environment,
              nutritional status and water stress levels on A n and g can be
              accounted for by appropriate adjustment of the capacity for
              rubisco to fix CO 2 . We estimate rubsico capacity from CO 2 and
              light saturated photosynthesis although leaf nitrogen content or
              rubisco assays from leaf extracts could also be used for this

                 tropical tree establishes in small gaps in the rainforest
                 canopy where direct sunlight can raise midday temperatures
                 markedly. We simulated this microclimate in a growth chamber
                 by varying air temperature between 28 and 38 degrees C at
                 constant vapor pressure. A decrease in stomatal conductance in
                 response to an increase in leaf-to-air vapor pressure
                 difference (deltaW) caused by an increase in leaf temperature
                 (Tleaf) was the principal reason for the decrease in net
                 photosynthesis between 28 and 33 degrees C. Net photosynthesis
                 decreased further between 33 and 38 degrees C. Direct effects
                 on mesophyll functioning and indirect effects through deltaW
                 were of similar magnitude in this temperature range.
                 Mitochondrial respiration during photosynthesis was
                 insensitive to Tleaf over the investigated temperature range;
                 it thus did not contribute to midday depression of net
                 photosynthesis. Internal conductance for CO2 diffusion in the
                 leaf, estimated by combined gas exchange and chlorophyll
                 fluorescence measurements, decreased slightly with increasing
                 Tleaf. However, the decrease in photosynthetic rate with
                 increasing Tleaf was larger and thus the difference in CO2
                 partial pressure between the substomatal cavity and
                 chloroplast was smaller, leading to the conclusion that this
                 factor was not causally involved in midday depression.
                 Carboxylation capacity inferred from the CO2 response of
                 photosynthesis increased between 28 and 33 degrees C, but
                 remained unchanged between 33 and 38 degrees C. Increased
                 oxygenation of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate relative to its
                 carboxylation and the concomitant increase in photorespiration
                 with increasing Tleaf were thus not compensated by an increase
                 in carboxylation capacity over the higher temperature range.

                 leaf expansion in early summer, when air temperature was
                 moderate and soil water availability was high. Thereafter,
                 Vcmax declined as the soil water profile became depleted and
                 the trees experienced extreme air temperatures, exceeding 40
                 degrees C. The decline in Vcmax was gradual in midsummer,
                 however, despite extremely low predawn leaf water potentials
                 (Psipd, approximately -4.0 MPa). Overall, temporal changes in
                 Vcmax were well correlated with changes in leaf nitrogen
                 content. During spring leaf development, high rates of leaf
                 dark respiration (Rd, 5-6 micromol m(-2) s(-1)) were observed.
                 Once a leaf reached maturity, Rd remained low, around 0.5
                 micromol m(-2) s(-1). In contrast to the strong seasonality of
                 Vcmax, m and marginal water cost per unit carbon gain (partial
                 partial differential E/ partial partial differential A) were
                 relatively constant over the season, even when leaf Psipd
                 dropped to -6.8 MPa. The constancy of partial partial
                 differential E/ partial partial differential A suggests that
                 stomata behaved optimally under severe water-stress
                 conditions. We discuss the implications of our findings in the

               in relation to single environmental variables in part because
               the interactions between factors have appeared difficult to
               quantify in a simple way. A linear correlation between stomatal
               conductance (g) and CO2 assimilation rate (A) has been reported
               when photon fluence was varied and when the photosynthetic
               capacity of leaves was altered by growth conditions, provided
               CO2, air humidity and leaf temperature were constant (1).
               Temperature and humidity are, however, not consistent in nature.
               Lack of a concise description of stomatal responses to
               combinations of environmental factors has limited attempts to
               integrate these responses into quantitative models of leaf
               energy balance, photosynthesis, and transpiration. Moreover,
               this lack has hindered progress toward understanding the
               stomatal mechanism. We have taken a multi-variant approach to
               the study of stomatal conductance and we show that under many

               leaf carbon metabolism and the environment to predict fluxes of
               CO2, H2O and energy. In this paper, we show how the model of

              for the 1850–2000 period offers the possibility of testing and
              calibrating the carbon budget in earth system models by comparing
              the simulated changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration and in
              land and ocean uptake with observation-based information. In
              particular, some of the uncertainties associated with the
              treatment of land use change (LUC) and the role of down
              regulation in affecting the strength of CO2 fertilization for
              terrestrial photosynthesis are assessed using the Canadian Centre
              for Climate Modelling and Analysis Earth System Model (CanESM1).
              LUC emissions may be specified as an external source of CO2 or
              calculated interactively based on estimated changes in crop area.
              The evidence for photosynthetic down regulation is reviewed and
              an empirically based representation is implemented and tested in
              the model. Four fully coupled simulations are performed: with and
              without terrestrial photosynthesis down regulation and with
              interactively determined or specified LUC emissions. Simulations
              without terrestrial photosynthesis down regulation yield 15–20
              ppm lower atmospheric CO2 by the end of the twentieth century,
              compared to observations, regardless of the LUC approach used
              because of higher carbon uptake by land. Implementation of down
              regulation brings simulated values of atmospheric CO2 and land
              and ocean carbon uptake closer to observation-based values. The
              use of specified LUC emissions yields a large source in the
              tropics during the 1981–2000 period, which is inconsistent with
              studies suggesting the tropics to be near-neutral or small carbon
              sinks. The annual cycle of simulated global averaged CO2,
              dominated by the Northern Hemisphere terrestrial photosynthesis
              and respiration cycles, is reasonably well reproduced, as is the
              latitudinal distribution of CO2 and the dependence of
              interhemispheric CO2 gradient on fossil fuel emissions. The
              empirical approach used here offers a reasonable method of
              implementing down regulation in coupled carbon–climate models in
              the absence of a more explicit biogeochemical representation.",

  abstract = "Abstract Process-based ecophysiological models, which simulate
              carbon exchange at the land-surface, are powerful and
              indispensable tools for understanding how vegetation behaves
              under present and future climate. However, these models are
              necessarily complex, containing numerous biophysical parameters
              which are often poorly defined. The current study develops a
              novel retrieval of Rubisco-limited top-of-canopy photosynthetic
              capacity (i.e. maximum carboxylation rate, V cmax 25 , toc ),
              which is one of the most critical parameters in the calculation
              of Gross Primary Productivity (GPP). The retrieval combines
              standard remote sensing satellite products of Leaf Area Index
              (LAI), from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
              (MODIS), with a hyperspectral index of total canopy chlorophyll
              concentration from the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer
              (MERIS). Monthly values of V cmax 25 , toc are determined over a
              9 year period for 296 global FLUXNET sites (catalogue made
              available online) and 8 Plant Functional Types (PFTs). PFT
              averages agree favourably with compilations of field-based
              measurements. However, according to a Monte Carlo analysis, our
              method is still currently subject to large systematic
              uncertainties (25–30\%), much of which arises from the empirical
              relationship between maximum electron transport and leaf
              chlorophyll content. For all 8 PFTs, except tropical broadleaf
              forest, V cmax 25 , toc varies considerably across the season
              (generally a factor of 1.6). Similarly, variability between sites
              of the same PFT is significant (interquartile range is 40\% of
              the median). This suggests an important additional role for
              satellites in the spatial and temporal parameterisation of carbon
              models. Inclusion of this temporal and spatial variability in a
              process-based ecophysiological model produces, respectively, an
              impact of 11\% and 12\% on simulated GPP.",

                 photosynthetic capacity peaks just after summer solstice and
                 declines with decreasing photoperiod, before air temperatures
                 peak. In support of these findings, saplings grown at constant
                 temperature but exposed to an extended photoperiod maintained

               simulations has been severely hampered by a lack of systematic

               a second step, the resulting functions are used to predict per

               known to be deficient in phosphorous. (3) of tropical trees

                 forced by a Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A2

               Mosses in northern ecosystems are ubiquitous components of plant
               communities, and strongly influence nutrient, carbon and water
               cycling. We use literature review, synthesis and model
               simulations to explore the role of mosses in ecological
               stability and resilience. Moss community responses to
               disturbance showed all possible responses (increases, decreases,
               no change) within most disturbance categories. Simulations from
               two process-based models suggest that northern ecosystems would
               need to experience extreme perturbation before mosses were
               eliminated. But simulations with two other models suggest that
               loss of moss will reduce soil carbon accumulation primarily by
               influencing decomposition rates and soil nitrogen availability.
               It seems clear that mosses need to be incorporated into models
               as one or more plant functional types, but more empirical work
               is needed to determine how to best aggregate species. We
               highlight several issues that have not been adequately explored
               in moss communities, such as functional redundancy and
               singularity, relationships between response and effect traits,
               and parameter vs conceptual uncertainty in models. Mosses play
               an important role in several ecosystem processes that play out
               over centuries – permafrost formation and thaw, peat
               accumulation, development of microtopography – and there is a
               need for studies that increase our understanding of slow,

               complex and time consuming; results depend on computational
               environments and numerous input parameters. Delays in learning
               and obtaining research results are inevitable. Students face
               disproportionate effort in the classroom or beginning
               graduate-level NWP research. Published NWP research is generally
               not reproducible, introducing uncertainty and slowing efforts
               that build on past results. This work exploits the rapid
               emergence of software container technology to produce a
               transformative research and education environment. The Weather
               Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model anchors a set of linked
               Linux-based containers, which include software to initialize and
               run the model, to analyze results, and to serve output to
               collaborators. The containers are demonstrated with a WRF
               simulation of Hurricane Sandy. The demonstration illustrates the
               following: 1) how the often-difficult exercise in compiling the
               WRF and its many dependencies is eliminated, 2) how sharing
               containers provides identical environments for conducting
               research, 3) that numerically reproducible results are easily
               obtainable, and 4) how uncertainty in the results can be
               isolated from uncertainty arising from computing system
               differences. Numerical experiments designed to simultaneously
               measure numerical reproducibility and sensitivity to compiler
               optimization provide guidance for interpreting NWP research.
               Reproducibility is independent from the operating system and
               hardware. Results here show numerically identical output on all
               computing platforms tested. Performance reproducibility is also
               demonstrated. The result is an infrastructure capable of

              hydraulic characteristics of the uppermost 0.5 m of organic
              soils. Review of the literature reveals that saturated hydraulic
              conductivity varies from a median of 1.0 × 10−7m/s in deeply
              humified sapric peat to 2.8 × 10−4 m/s in relatively undecomposed
              fibric peat. Average pore volume fraction ranges from 0.83 to
              0.93. Parameters have been designed for the soil moisture
              characteristic curves for fibric, hemic and sapric peat using the
              Campbell (1974) equation employed in CLASS, and the van Genuchten

  abstract = "Recently a number of studies have found significant differences
              between Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)
              land surface mapping and the land surface parameters of the
              Community Land Model (CLM) of the Community Climate System Model
              (CCSM). To address these differences in land surface description,
              we have developed new CLM 3.0 land surface parameters that
              reproduce the physical properties described in the MODIS land
              surface data while maintaining the multiple Plant Functional Type
              (PFT) canopy and herbaceous layer representation used in CLM.
              These new parameters prescribe crop distributions directly from
              historical crop mapping allowing cropping to be described in CLM
              for any year from 1700 to current day. The new model parameters
              are calculated at 0.05 degrees resolution so they can be
              aggregated and used over a wider range of model grid resolutions
              globally. Compared to the current CLM 3.0 parameters, the new
              parameters have an increase in bare soil fraction of 10\% which
              is realized through reduced tree, shrub, and crop cover. The new
              parameters also have area average increases of 10\% for leaf area
              index (LAI) and stem area index (SAI) values, with the largest
              increases in tropical forests. The new land surface parameters
              have strong repeatable impacts on the climate simulated in CCSM
              3.0 with large improvements in surface albedo compared to MODIS
              values. In many cases the improvements in surface albedo directly
              resulted in improved simulation of precipitation and near-surface
              air temperature; however, for the most part the existing biases
              of CCSM 3.0 remained with the new parameters. Further analysis of
              changes in surface hydrology revealed that the increased LAI of
              the new parameters resulted in lower overall evapotranspiration
              with reduced precipitation in CCSM 3.0. This was an unexpected
              result given that other research into the impacts of vegetation
              change suggests that the new parameters should have the opposite
              impact. This suggests that while the new parameters significantly
              improve the climate simulated in CLM 3.0 and CCSM 3.0, the new
              surface parameters have limited success in rectifying surface
              hydrology biases that result from the parameterizations within
              the CLM 3.0.",

  abstract = "The Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS) coupled to the Canadian
              Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (CTEM) is used to simulate
              competition between the model's seven non-crop plant functional
              types (PFTs) for available space. Our objective is to assess if
              the model is successfully able to reproduce the observed mix of
              PFTs and their fractional coverages, and to what extent the
              simulated competition is affected by the manner in which the
              sub-grid scale variability of vegetation is represented. The
              model can be run either in a composite (single tile)
              configuration, where structural vegetation attributes of PFTs are
              aggregated for use in grid-averaged energy and water balance
              calculations, or a mosaic (multiple tiles) configuration, where
              separate energy and water balance calculations are performed for
              each PFT. The model realistically simulates the fractional
              coverages of trees, grasses and bare ground, as well as that of
              individual tree and grass PFTs and their succession patterns. Our
              results show that the model is not overly sensitive to the manner
              in which sub-grid scale variability of vegetation is represented.
              Of the seven sites chosen across the globe to illustrate the
              difference between the two configurations, the simulated
              fractional coverage of PFTs are generally very similar (root mean
              square difference, RMSD, 5 \%).",

  abstract  = "We investigate the application of clustering algorithms to
               represent sub-grid scale variability in soil texture for use in
               a global-scale terrestrial ecosystem model. Our model, the
               coupled Canadian Land Surface Scheme – Canadian Terrestrial
               Ecosystem Model (CLASS-CTEM), is typically implemented at a
               coarse spatial resolution (approximately 2. 8° × 2. 8°) due to
               its use as the land surface component of the Canadian Earth
               System Model (CanESM). CLASS-CTEM can, however, be run with
               tiling of the land surface as a means to represent sub-grid
               heterogeneity. We first determined that the model was sensitive
               to tiling of the soil textures via an idealized test case before
               attempting to cluster soil textures globally. To cluster a
               high-resolution soil texture dataset onto our coarse model grid,
               we use two linked algorithms – the Ordering Points to Identify
               the Clustering Structure (OPTICS) algorithm (Ankerst et al.,
               1999; Daszykowski et al., 2002) and the algorithm of Sander et
               al. (2003) – to provide tiles of representative soil textures
               for use as CLASS-CTEM inputs. The clustering process results in,
               on average, about three tiles per CLASS-CTEM grid cell with most
               cells having four or less tiles. Results from CLASS-CTEM
               simulations conducted with the tiled inputs (Cluster) versus
               those using a simple grid-mean soil texture (Gridmean) show
               CLASS-CTEM, at least on a global scale, is relatively
               insensitive to the tiled soil textures; however, differences can
               be large in arid or peatland regions. The Cluster simulation has
               generally lower soil moisture and lower overall vegetation
               productivity than the Gridmean simulation except in arid regions
               where plant productivity increases. In these dry regions, the
               influence of the tiling is stronger due to the general state of
               vegetation moisture stress which allows a single tile, whose
               soil texture retains more plant-available water, to yield much
               higher productivity. Although the use of clustering analysis
               appears promising as a means to represent sub-grid
               heterogeneity, soil textures appear to be reasonably represented
               for global-scale simulations using a simple grid-mean value.",
