! Physics switches:

    IDISP = 0 ,   !  This switch controls the calculation of the vegetation displacement height. In most
                  !atmospheric models a “terrain-following” coordinate system is used, in which the vegetation
                  !displacement height is considered to be part of the “terrain”, and is therefore neglected. 
                  ! For such applications IDISP is set to 0. For studies making use of field data, it should be set to 1.
    IZREF = 2 ,   !This switch indicates where the bottom of the atmosphere is conceptually located. In
                  !most atmospheric models the bottom is assumed to lie at the local surface roughness length, 
                  ! i.e. where the horizontal wind speed is zero; for such simulations IZREF is set to 2. For 
                  ! all other cases, including sites using field data, it should be set to 1.
    ZRFH = 40.0,  ! The reference heights at which the energy variables (air temperature and specific humidity) are provided. When 
                  ! using field data this is the measurement height. 
    ZRFM = 40.0,  ! The reference heights at which the momentum variables (wind speed) are provided. When using field data this is the measurement height. 
    ZBLD = 50.0,  ! The atmospheric blending height.  Technically this variable depends on the length scale of the
                  ! patches of roughness elements on the land surface, but this is difficult to ascertain.  Usually it is assigned a value of 50 m.
    ISLFD = 0 ,   ! This switch indicates which surface layer flux stability
                  ! correction and screen-level diagnostic subroutines are to be
                  ! used. If ISLFD=0, the CCCma stability correction subroutine
                  ! DRCOEF is used with simple similarity-based screen-level
                  ! diagnostic calculations. If ISLFD=1, DRCOEF is used for the
                  ! stability corrections and the RPN subroutine SLDIAG is used
                  ! for the screen level diagnostic calculations. If ISLFD=2, the
                  ! RPN stability correction subroutine FLXSURFZ is used with the
                  ! companion RPN subroutine DIASURFZ for the screen level
                  ! diagnostics. (When running CLASS coupled to an atmospheric 
                  ! model with staggered vertical thermodynamic and momentum
                  ! levels, ISLFD must be set to 2, since FLXSURFZ allows inputs
                  ! on staggered levels and DRCOEF does not.)
    IPCP = 1 ,    ! if ipcp=1, the rainfall-snowfall cutoff is taken to lie at 0 C. if ipcp=2, a linear partitioning of precipitation between
                  ! rainfall and snowfall is done between 0 C and 2 C. if ipcp=3, rainfall and snowfall are partitioned according to
                  ! a polynomial curve between 0 C and 6 C.
    IWF = 0 ,     ! if iwf=0, only overland flow and baseflow are modelled, and the ground surface slope is not modelled. if iwf=n (0<n<4),
                  ! the watflood calculations of overland flow and interflow are performed; interflow is drawn from the top n soil layers.
    isnoalb = 0 , ! if isnoalb is set to 0, the original two-band snow albedo algorithms are used. 
                  ! if it is set to 1, the new four-band routines are used. 
                  ! At present, the four band algorithm should NOT be used offline.

 ! Iteration scheme
    ! ITC, ITCG and ITG are switches to choose the iteration scheme to be used in calculating the canopy or ground surface temperature
    ! respectively.  if the switch is set to 1, a bisection method is used; if to 2, the newton-raphson method is used. (Note: Recently
    ! problems have been discovered with the Newton-Raphson scheme, involving instabilities and occasional failure to converge, so 
    ! currently users are advised not to select this option.)

    ITCG = 1 ,  ! Ground under canopy
    ITG = 1 ,   ! Ground

 ! User-supplied values:
    ! if ipai, ihgt, ialc, ials and ialg are zero, the values of plant area index, vegetation height, canopy albedo, snow albedo
    ! and soil albedo respectively calculated by class are used. if any of these switches is set to 1, the value of the
